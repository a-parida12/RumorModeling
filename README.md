# RumorModeling
The code pertaining to the Master Seminar: Computational Social Science at TU Munich by [Prof. Jurgen Pfeffer](http://www.pfeffer.at/).

This repository contains python based implementation of the rumor modelling technique described in the paper "[Modeling Rumors:The No Plane Pentagon French Hoax Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211571)" by [Serge Galam](mailto:galam@ccr.jussieu.fr) of CNRS, Paris.

The presentation for the seminar showcasing the implementation of the paper along with some of my original work can be seen [here](https://github.com/a-parida12/RumorModeling/blob/master/MODELING%20RUMORS_%20THE%20NO%20PLANE%20PENTAGON%20FRENCH%20HOAX%20CASE.pdf)
